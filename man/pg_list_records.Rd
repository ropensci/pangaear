\usage{
pg_list_records(prefix = "oai_dc", from = NULL, until = NULL,
  set = NULL, transform = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{prefix}{A character string to specify the metadata format in OAI-PMH requests issued to
the repository. The default ("oai_dc") corresponds to the mandatory OAI unqualified Dublin Core
metadata schema.}

\item{from}{Character strings giving datestamps to be used as lower or upper bounds,
respectively, for datestamp-based selective harvesting (i.e., only harvest records with
datestamps in the given range). Dates and times must be encoded using ISO 8601. The trailing
Z must be used when including time. OAI-PMH implies UTC for data/time specifications.}

\item{until}{Character string giving a datestamp to be used as an upper bound,
for datestamp-based selective harvesting (i.e., only harvest records with datestamps in
the given range).}

\item{set}{A character string giving a set to be used for selective harvesting (i.e., only
harvest records in the given set).}

\item{transform}{A logical indicating whether the OAI-PMH XML results to “useful” R data
structures via oaih_transform. Default: true.}
